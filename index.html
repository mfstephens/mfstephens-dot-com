                Hi there. I'm Matt Stephens. I'm a student at the University of Michigan in my third year studying computer science. I like programming, music, and fine dining (especially good beer).
                </p>
                <p>
                I have experience with JavaScript (and all its friends including Backbone, Angular, jQuery, & Node), HTML+CSS, and C++. You can head over and check out my <input type="button" class="projects link" value="projects"></input> to see some stuff I've worked on.
                </p>
                <p>
                Though I am currently employed as a software engineering intern at <a href="http://www.techsmith.com" class="link">TechSmith Corporation</a> until September 2013, I'm always looking for fun projects to work on. So, Interested in seeing me struggle to write code? <input type="button" class="contact link" value="Hit me up"></input>.
